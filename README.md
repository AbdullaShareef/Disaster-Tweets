# Disaster-Tweets
Twitter has become a critical platform for real-time communication during emergencies. With the widespread use of smartphones, individuals can instantly report incidents they are witnessing, allowing disaster relief organizations and news agencies to monitor Twitter for important updates. However, distinguishing between tweets that genuinely report a disaster and those that use similar language metaphorically presents a unique challenge for machine learning models.

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to classify tweets as disaster-related or not. The dataset consists of 10,000 tweets that were manually labeled to indicate whether they pertain to real disasters. The goal of this project is to build a model that accurately predicts which tweets are related to actual disasters and which are not, helping organizations and responders identify critical situations more efficiently.
